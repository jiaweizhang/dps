<h2>Our Mission</h2>
<p>The three main missions of the Duke Partnership for Service are to Support, Connect, and Inspire. We exist firstly to
    support and provide resources for all student service organizations on campus, especially the 65+ that are
    recognized as dPS organizations. We also strive to connect Duke students with service organizations and community
    projects that match their passions and interests. Finally, we aim to unite Duke students together and help inspire
    them towards goals of social justice and meaningful community engagement.</p>
